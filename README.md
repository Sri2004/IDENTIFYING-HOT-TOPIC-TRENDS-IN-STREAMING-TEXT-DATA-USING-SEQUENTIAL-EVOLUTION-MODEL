# IDENTIFYING-HOT-TOPIC-TRENDS-IN-STREAMING-TEXT-DATA-USING-SEQUENTIAL-EVOLUTION-MODEL
This project proposes a sequential evolution model using distributed representations to detect hot topic trends in streaming text. By applying word2vec on chronological datasets, we capture semantic changes, build knowledge graphs, and visualize evolving topics, outperforming traditional methods.
